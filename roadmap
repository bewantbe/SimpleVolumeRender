* Select an object by mouse i.e. set it to "active".
  - by single click.                    (done for swc point)
  - by box selection, multiple object.
* "Fly to" an active object.            (done for volume, picked point)
* Dynamical loading/off-loading.        (done loading, but not off-loading)
    - On demand loading of ims file and flsm file.
* Visually focus local area
  - by mask volume partially.           (done)
  - by rebuild a volume.
  - also mask outside fiber.
* Show 3D cursor.                       (done using sphere)
* Add transition animation framework for moving viewport
  - Make Y direction the up direction.
  - rotation.
* ability to output scene file corresponding to current view. (done)
* View up                               (done)
* Support touch screen (StartPinchEvent, PinchEvent, EndPinchEvent), (SwipeEvent, StartSwipeEvent, EndSwipeEvent)
* Support VR.
* Support stereo view.                  (done)
* Custom volume rendering.

* use off-screen rendering for auto unit test

* improve the parallel parsing of SWC file by batching.
  - almost done, debug where slow, probably the data transfer part.
  - done for now

* Design an interface for user script?
  - Use object property to serves the use (analysing) script.
    - almost done

* try to test the sparse matrix loop finding by using the matrix multiple.
* Solve windows Fn key and Home/Del key capture problem? such as receive the KeyPressEvent () (instead of now CharEvent())
* Use Namespace instead of dict for data exchange?
* Thinking of use message(event)/callbacks mechanism, to replace the now input/configure/parser mechanism, especially to deal with event priority. e.g. after parse the commandline, sort the events according to the priority, then the GUIControl comsumes the event by the order, also there maybe a special class to deal with the sorting and batch pop-out.
* Try touch screen interaction, such as PinchEvent. See https://vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkRenderWindowInteractor.html#details
* try GetPickingManager (), GetPicker()
* try the VR
* Use GetInitialized () to set sleep time?
* SetInteractorStyle() switching

* why GetTimerEventId (), GetVTKTimerId () not work??  See here https://vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkRenderWindowInteractor.html#a7ef06e3e7c8cff5767c3b0d328934f55

* seems usefull: AddRepresentation()  see https://vtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/VTKUsersGuide.pdf

* better raycast?: vtkVolumeRayCastCompositeFunction 

* vtkOBJReader  read .obj


## 2023-01-13

* Solve the window init flash problem

* Use direction keys to navigate (go forward, backward, left, right, with shift to rotate, or small keyboard)

* Support drag and drop to load data.

* Command-Line Application Layouts

* Bug: after loading volume with colorscale set, press +/- will get wired rendering results.

* set window size automatically, and allow command line

* allow loading obj file.
