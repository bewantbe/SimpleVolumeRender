* Select an object by mouse i.e. set it to "active".
  - by single click.                    (done for swc point)
  - by box selection, multiple object.
* "Fly to" an active object.            (done for volume, picked point)
* Dynamical loading/off-loading.        (done loading, but not off-loading)
    - On demand loading of ims file and flsm file.
* Visually focus local area
  - by mask volume partially.           (done)
  - by rebuild a volume.
  - also mask outside fiber.
* Show 3D cursor.                       (done using sphere)
* Add transition animation framework for moving viewport
  - Make Y direction the up direction.
  - rotation.
* ability to output scene file corresponding to current view. (done)
* View up                               (done)
* Support touch screen (StartPinchEvent, PinchEvent, EndPinchEvent), (SwipeEvent, StartSwipeEvent, EndSwipeEvent)
* Support VR.
* Support stereo view.                  (done)
